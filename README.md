# canvas-experiments
Slowly but surely testing out the possibilities of html5's canvas.

Experiment 1:
Generating balls with random angles with collision detection. 
Block can be dragged and dropped with some form of collision with the balls.
Add a ball with spacebar.

Experiment 2:
Static "blockout" page rendered on Canvas.

Experiment 3:
Painting in Canvas - 
Use your mouse to paint, the stroke will fade-out.
New stroke generates new color.
